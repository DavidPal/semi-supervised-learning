\section{Halfspaces}
\label{section:halfspaces}

In this section, we denote by $C_n$ the class of halfspaces over $\X = \R^n$. There
are infinitely many functions in $C_n$. For every non-zero vector $w \in \R^n$, there is a half space
$$
c_w(x) = \indicator{\ip{w}{x} \ge 0} \qquad \qquad \text{for any $x \in \R^n$} \; .
$$
Note that since only the sign of the inner product $\ip{w}{x}$ plays a role, for
any $\alpha > 0$, the functions $c_w$ and $c_{\alpha w}$ are the identical.

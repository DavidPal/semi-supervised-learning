Semi-Supervised Learning
========================

Paper titled _The Information-Theoretic Value of Unlabeled Data in
Semi-Supervised Learning_ by [Alexander Golovnev](https://golovnev.org/), [Dávid
Pál](http://david.palenica.com/) and [Balázs
Szörényi](http://www.inf.u-szeged.hu/~szorenyi/) accepted at [ICML

The paper proves that unlabeled data beneficial for supervised learning tasks.
We formalized the problem in the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) model and
we show that for learning projections over the Boolean  hypercube
<b>{0,1}<sup>n</sup></b> one needs  less labeled examples by a multiplicative
factor <b>&Theta;(log n)</b> if one has access to unlabeled data.
